        A hands-on lab activity demonstrating the fundamentals of containerizing a web application.
        The project uses a simple Node.js app to showcase the Docker lifecycle: building images, running containers, and managing services with Docker Compose.

        Key Concepts:
        - Dockerfile: Defining the image environment and dependencies.
        - Docker CLI: Practical experience with build, run, stop, and rm commands.
        - Docker Compose: Orchestrating the application with a declarative YAML configuration.

        A critical review of the research article "Virtualization vs. Containerization... Focused on the Edge".
        The report evaluates the performance and efficiency of VMs vs. Docker in resource-constrained environments.

        Key Findings:
        - Short-Term Jobs: Containers (Docker/Podman) are ~40% more efficient for quick tasks.
        - Long-Running Services: Kubernetes surpasses Docker in power efficiency for sustained workloads.
        - Edge Efficiency: Native ARM containers on Raspberry Pi perform comparably to native execution, while cross-arch emulation is poor.

        Conclusion:
        - Containers: Best for flexibility and edge efficiency.
        - Kubernetes: Optimal for complex, long-term services.
        - VMs: Essential for strict isolation or specific OS requirements.

        fullDescription: `
        Infrastructure as Code meets Survival RPG. This project demonstrates clean architecture and IaC principles by using Terraform to control game mechanics.

        How Terraform Controls the Game:
        - Configuration as Code: Game settings (difficulty, resource decay, spawn rates) are defined in \`variables.tf\`.
        - Infrastructure Provisioning: Running \`terraform apply\` generates a \`config.js\` file that the game engine reads.
        - Automated Deployment: A GitHub Actions workflow triggers on push, applying the Terraform configuration and deploying the updated game to GitHub Pages.

        Key Features:
        - Interactive UI: A fully functional browser-based survival game with crafting, inventory, and health systems.
        - Dynamic Difficulty: Adjust the game's challenge level simply by changing Terraform variables and redeploying.
